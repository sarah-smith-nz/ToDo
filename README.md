Steps Followed:
1.  Design a database to store a list of tasks, e.g. task details, priority, completed yes/no
1.  Build the migrations and seed data
1.  Build an API to list, add, update and delete
1.  Test your API with Postman/Insomnia
1.  Build React Components from static html
1.  Design Redux Global State (think of it like a JS object)
1.  Build Redux Reducers (the properties or keys of your state design are reducers, the values are hard-code static data as initialState)
1.  Build API Client in the front end
1.  Build Redux Actions to save task data from the API (remove hard-code initialState)
